        I am an experienced software developer looking to combine my skills in
        application and systems programming with my personal interest in
        computational statistical analysis. I would be very interested in joining a
        medium to large team in the Southeast Michigan area!

        In my personal time I am an avid gardener and just couldn't help but
        to combine this with my interests in programming and data
        analysis! I use micro-computers running various sensors to capture,
        display, and analyze metrics related to my gardens. All kinds of
        interesting correlations can be made between temperature,
        moisture level, hours of light and plant health. Plus, it makes it really
        easy to know when to water your plants!

        <p>
          In my last position I was hired to help a local screen printing
          manufacturer modernize their web ecosystem. Over the course of the
          last two years I presented prototypes for replacement systems,
          managed contractors working on existing and new systems, and supported
          existing systems personally. I worked with a variety of programming languages
          while taking requirements directly from the business owner. I also
          assisted in growing the IT department by recruiting, interviewing,
          hiring, and training other employees.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the systems that I worked on was our new mobile site. We
          deployed an ASP.NET Core solution to a Debian 9 Stretch instance in
          the cloud to create a responsive mobile site that is stable and low
          cost to run. This sort of development system combines compiled web
          server code with Linux solutions. Its very exciting!
        </p>
        <p>
          I loved my position at Versatrans, I got the opportunity to deploy
          modern technologies I was excited about and develop entire systems
          from the ground up while working directly with my end-users. That being
          said, at a smaller company it is often required that you wear many
          different hats. I would be dealing with a downed VOIP phone system one
          moment and then going back to my system designing the next. I am looking
          for the chance to specialize closer to my interests in programming,
          data analysis, and system design.

      <div class="company">Hewlett-Packard, Pontiac</div>
      </div>
      <div class="details">
        <p>
          At Hewlett-Packard I worked in the Enterprise Services division,
          where I would be assigned to client accounts to assist them in
          developing new features for existing applications. I worked
          primarily on desktop and server code, writing primarily in C, C++, C#,
          and Java.
        </p>
        <p>
          Projects at HP were backed by huge, longstanding code bases that
          thousands of clients relied on daily and were used to perform a wide
          array of tasks. Working in
          that environment I learned to plan and test my changes carefully and
          contribute effectively as a member of a large development team in an
          active lifecycle. I worked primarily on two projects, the first of which
          was an IT monitoring system for Shell Oil's internal network, the other was
          an embedded dashboard for Caterpillar locomotives.
        </p>
        <p>
          My position at Hewlett-Packard was a great opportunity and sparked a
          life-long interest in the fields of monitoring, data analysis, and
          embedded systems. However, when I was offered a position to build
          and run my own environment, I jumped at the chance to try some of the
          technologies I had been learning on my own!
